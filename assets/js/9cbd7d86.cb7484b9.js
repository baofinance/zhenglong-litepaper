It merges a technically rigorous design - featuring automated rebalancing, dynamic fees, and a capital-efficient three-token system - with a clear, user-centric mission: to make stable yield and safe leverage available to everyone.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"genesis-vaults":{"id":"genesis-vaults","title":"Genesis Vaults: Bootstrapping New Markets","description":"To launch new synthetic asset markets in a fair and balanced way, Zhenglong uses a powerful tool called a Genesis Vault. This is a one-time opportunity where early users help kickstart a market by depositing collateral - and in return, they receive both sides of that market: a zheTOKENS (stable) token and a steamedTOKEN (leveraged) token.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Welcome to Zhenglong","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"key-features":{"id":"key-features","title":"Key Features at a Glance","description":"Zhenglong offers a comprehensive set of features designed to revolutionize synthetic asset trading:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"liquidation-protection":{"id":"liquidation-protection","title":"Re-balancing Leverage and Extreme Market Scenarios","description":"Zhenglong is built to protect its users from the chaos often seen in leveraged trading. Instead of sudden margin calls and forced position closures, it takes a proactive, multi-layered approach to risk - giving users more time and tools to react while keeping the system stable.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"post-genesis":{"id":"post-genesis","title":"Post-Genesis Operations: Minting, Redemption, and Dynamic Fees","description":"Once a new market launches via a Genesis Vault, Zhenglong enters its regular operating mode. From here on out, users can mint new tokens or redeem existing ones at any time, depending on what kind of exposure they want.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"risks":{"id":"risks","title":"Risks: What if Bad Stuff Happens?","description":"While Zhenglong is designed with multiple layers of protection, it\'s important to understand the risks and edge cases that could affect the system. This transparency helps users make informed decisions about their participation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"stability-pools":{"id":"stability-pools","title":"Stability Pools and Automated Rebalancing","description":"One of Zhenglong\'s most important concepts is its on-chain Stability Pools - automated mechanisms that act as a safety net for the entire protocol. These pools are what make re-balancing possible for steamedTOKENS, while also keeping zheTOKENS stable and properly collateralized. In other systems, external re-balancers and arbitrageurs manage this process. In Zhenglong, it happens preemptively and transparently, with no middlemen.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"steam-token":{"id":"steam-token","title":"STEAM Token: Governance, Yield, and Long-Term Alignment","description":"The STEAM token is the governance and utility backbone of the Zhenglong ecosystem. While it\'s not directly involved in minting or redeeming zheTOKENS and steamedTOKENS, it plays a crucial role in shaping the future of the protocol - and in rewarding those who support it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"three-token-model":{"id":"three-token-model","title":"Three-Token Model and 100% Collateral Efficiency","description":"At the heart of Zhenglong is a smart three-token structure that powers each market: a Collateral Token, a zheTOKENS (the stable, pegged asset), and a steamedTOKEN (the leveraged asset). This design ensures 100% of your collateral is always put to use - nothing sits idle.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"use-cases":{"id":"use-cases","title":"Use Cases and Vision for the Future","description":"Zhenglong is more than just a synthetic asset protocol - it\'s a modular platform for transforming any real-world or on-chain price feed into a yield-bearing asset and variable leveraged token. Whether you\'re looking for stable returns, dynamic trading tools, or new ways to structure financial products, Zhenglong opens up a vast playground of possibilities that bridge TradFi and DeFi.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
