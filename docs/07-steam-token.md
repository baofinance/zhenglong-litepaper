# STEAM Token: Governance, Yield, and Long-Term Alignment

The STEAM token is the governance and utility backbone of the Zhenglong ecosystem. While it's not directly involved in minting or redeeming zheTOKENS and steamedTOKENS, it plays a crucial role in shaping the future of the protocol - and in rewarding those who support it.

Holding STEAM isn't just about passive speculation. It's about owning a stake in Zhenglong's growth, security, and direction.

## 1. Governance Rights

STEAM holders have voting power over how Zhenglong evolves. Community members can propose or vote on:

- New markets to launch
- Fee or collateral ratio adjustments
- Protocol upgrades

To participate in governance, you lock up your STEAM tokens in a voting escrow system (called veSTEAM, similar to Curve's veCRV model). The longer you lock, the more influence you gain - and the more rewards you earn.

This setup rewards long-term thinking community members.

## 2. Revenue Sharing

Zhenglong generates revenue from several sources:

- Minting and redemption fees
- A portion of the yield earned by collateral

By converting STEAM to veSTEAM, you become eligible for a share of this revenue. Distribution methods can vary:

- Direct rebates
- Periodic payouts
- Buy-and-burn strategies

In short: if the system grows and generates more fees, STEAM holders benefit, making them directly aligned with the protocol's success.

## 3. Yield Boosts and Incentive Rewards

STEAM also plays a major role in rewarding active contributors:

- Genesis Vault participants and Stability Pool depositors earn STEAM.
- Liquidity providers (LPs) supplying zheTOKENS or steamedTOKENS to AMMs can also earn STEAM incentives.

But that's not all - holding and locking STEAM boosts your rewards:

- The more STEAM you lock, the higher your returns in Stability Pools or liquidity mining programs.
- This model encourages holders to stay engaged, rather than just dump tokens on the market.

This approach, inspired by DeFi pioneers like Curve and Convex, helps foster a committed and incentivized community - one that grows with the protocol, not apart from it.
