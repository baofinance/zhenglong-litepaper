# STEAM Token

The STEAM token is the governance and utility backbone of the Zhenglong ecosystem. While it's not directly involved in minting or redeeming zheTOKENS and steamedTOKENS, it plays a crucial role in shaping the future of the protocol - and in rewarding those who support it.

Holding STEAM isn't just about passive speculation. It's about owning a stake in Zhenglong's growth, security, and direction.

## 1. Governance Rights

STEAM holders have voting power over how Zhenglong evolves. Community members can propose or vote on:

- New markets to launch
- Fee or collateral ratio adjustments
- Protocol upgrades

To participate in governance, you lock up your STEAM tokens in a voting escrow system (called veSTEAM, similar to Curve's veCRV model). The longer you lock, the more influence you gain - and the more rewards you earn.

This setup rewards long-term thinking community members.

## 2. Revenue Sharing

Zhenglong generates revenue from several sources:

- Minting and redemption fees
- A portion of the yield earned by collateral

By converting STEAM to veSTEAM, you become eligible for a share of this revenue. Distribution methods can vary:

- Direct rebates
- Periodic payouts
- Buy-and-burn strategies

In short: if the system grows and generates more fees, STEAM holders benefit, making them directly aligned with the protocol's success.

## 3. Yield Boosts and Incentive Rewards

STEAM also plays a major role in rewarding active contributors:

- Genesis Vault participants and Stability Pool depositors earn STEAM.
- Liquidity providers (LPs) supplying zheTOKENS or steamedTOKENS to AMMs can also earn STEAM incentives.

But that's not all - holding and locking STEAM boosts your rewards:

- The more STEAM you lock, the higher your returns in Stability Pools or liquidity mining programs.
- This model encourages holders to stay engaged, rather than just dump tokens on the market.

This approach, inspired by DeFi pioneers like Curve and Convex, helps foster a committed and incentivized community - one that grows with the protocol, not apart from it.

# STEAM Tokenomics

Zhenglong is built to reward long-term participation, decentralize governance, and create sustainable liquidity incentives. All token allocations are transparently structured and time-released.

**Total Supply:** 100,000,000 $STEAM

## 🔒 Locked Governance Supply

The Bao Treasury and FX Protocol Allocation are both committed to permanent max lock as veSTEAM once vested.

These make up a minimum of **28% of the token supply** that is guaranteed to be locked and actively contributing to protocol governance and emission direction.

_On the chart, this is shown as an overlay line labeled:_

> 🟢 Minimum locked as veSTEAM (Bao + FX Protocol)

## 📉 Emissions Logic

**Protocol Incentives (39%)**

- Year 1: 5,000,000 tokens emitted linearly
- Following years: each emits 12.9% less than the year before
- Modeled after Curve's emissions: decaying emissions with a long tail
- Emission lifespan: ~50+ years

**veBAO Airdrops (5%)**

- Year 1: 500,000 tokens (linear)
- Each subsequent year emits 10% less than the year before
- Also spans ~50+ years
- Designed to reward long-term aligned governance holders

## 📊 STEAM 5 Year Emissions

This chart shows:

- 📦 Cumulative token release over the first 5 years
- 🟩 Stacked areas for each allocation category
- 🔒 An overlay line for the minimum number of max-locked veSTEAM tokens from the Bao and FX Protocol allocations

The categories with immediate or early liquidity — IDO, Initial Liquidity, and Genesis — appear at the base for clarity.

_All values are linear unless stated otherwise. No cliffs. No surprise unlocks._
