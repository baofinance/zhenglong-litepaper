# Key Features at a Glance

Zhenglong offers a comprehensive set of features designed to revolutionize synthetic asset trading:

## Fully Backed Pegged Tokens

zheTOKENS are always 100% collateralized by yield-bearing assets and can be redeemed 1:1, providing stable value and integrated yield.

## Re-balancing Leverage

steamedTOKENS give leveraged exposure without the risk of forced position closures or funding costs. Volatility is automatically managed by the protocol through shared, proportional re-balancing.

## On-Chain Stability Pools

These replace external re-balancers. They absorb risk and rebalance the system when stress hits. Depositors earn the collateral's yield plus STEAM rewards.

## Dynamic Fee Mechanics

Fees on minting and redemption adjust based on system health. They rise to discourage harmful actions and can even turn negative to reward helpful ones.

## STEAM Token Governance & Rewards

The STEAM token is the heartbeat of governance and incentives. STEAM holders vote on protocol changes, share in revenues, and boost their rewards across the ecosystem.
